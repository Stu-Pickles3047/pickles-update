.TH UPDATE 1 "September 4, 2025" "Pickles Linux" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
update \- a bash script to update a Pickles Linux system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update
.RI [
.I OPTIONS
.RI ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B update
script is a helper utility for managing system updates on Pickles Linux. It is a wrapper for
.B paru
that automates the update process and provides an optional mirror rating feature. The script first displays a welcome message, then checks for command-line options, performs the update using
.B paru
, and finally prompts the user to reboot the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-m , \-\-mirrors
This option triggers a mirror rating process before the system update. It uses the
.B rate-mirrors
tool to find the fastest mirrors for your system and then saves the new mirror list. This can significantly speed up future downloads.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
The script ran successfully and the user chose not to reboot.
.TP
.B Any other value
The script terminated due to an error, such as a failed
.B paru
update.
.SH NOTES
The script uses
.B tput
for colorized output. If your terminal does not support colors, the output will appear as plain text with some extra characters.
.PP
The script uses
.B sudo
to run
.B paru
and to save the new mirror list. It requires the user to have
.B sudo
privileges.
.PP
After a successful update, the script will ask if you want to reboot. This is recommended to ensure that all changes are applied correctly, especially after a kernel update.
.PP
If you've just finished a system update using this script, you may need to restart to apply all changes. As you're running a new Sway installation, it's a good practice to reboot after a major system update to ensure everything is loaded correctly.
