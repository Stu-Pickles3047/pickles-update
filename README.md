# Pickles Update

A user-friendly wrapper script for `paru` to manage system updates on Arch Linux-based distributions like Pickles Linux. This tool simplifies the update process, includes an optional mirror rating feature, and prompts for a reboot after a successful update.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Automated Updates**: Runs `paru -Syu` to update all packages.
- **Mirror Rating**: Optionally finds and uses the fastest mirrors for your system using `rate-mirrors`.
- **Reboot Prompt**: Asks for a reboot after the update to ensure all changes, especially kernel updates, are applied correctly.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install `pickles-update`, you can use `paru` directly from this Git repository. This is the recommended method as it handles all dependencies automatically.

```bash
paru -S [https://github.com/Stu-Pickles3047/pickles-update.git](https://github.com/Stu-Pickles3047/pickles-update.git)
```

## ðŸ›  Usage

Once installed, you can run the `update` command from your terminal.

- To run a standard system update:
  ```bash
  update
  ```

- To run a system update and rate mirrors first (recommended for faster downloads):
  ```bash
  update --mirrors
  # or using the shorthand
  update -m
  ```

## ðŸ“„ Man Page

A man page is included with the package. You can view it by running:

```bash
man update
```
